# **Section 4.4: Monotone Functions and Discontinuities**

### **I. Right and Left Limits**

**1. Definitions**
Let $E \subset \mathbb{R}$ and $f: E \to \mathbb{R}$.
* **Right Limit ($f(p+)$):** Suppose $p$ is a limit point of $E \cap (p, \infty)$.
    $$\lim_{x \to p^+} f(x) = L \iff \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0 \text{ such that } |f(x) - L| < \epsilon \text{ whenever } p < x < p + \delta.$$
* **Left Limit ($f(p-)$):** Suppose $p$ is a limit point of $E \cap (-\infty, p)$.
    $$\lim_{x \to p^-} f(x) = L \iff \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0 \text{ such that } |f(x) - L| < \epsilon \text{ whenever } p - \delta < x < p.$$

**2. Relationship to General Limits**
For $p \in \text{Int}(I)$, $\lim_{x \to p} f(x)$ exists if and only if:
1.  Both $f(p+)$ and $f(p-)$ exist.
2.  $f(p+) = f(p-)$.

**3. One-Sided Continuity**
* **Right Continuous at $p$:** $\lim_{x \to p^+} f(x) = f(p)$.
* **Left Continuous at $p$:** $\lim_{x \to p^-} f(x) = f(p)$.
* **Theorem 4.4.3:** $f$ is continuous at $p$ iff $f(p+) = f(p-) = f(p)$.

### **II. Classification of Discontinuities**

If $f$ is discontinuous at $p$, it falls into one of two main categories:

**1. Simple Discontinuities (First Kind)**
Both $f(p+)$ and $f(p-)$ exist.
* **Removable Discontinuity:** $f(p+)$ and $f(p-)$ exist and are equal, but differ from $f(p)$ (or $f(p)$ is undefined).
    * *Example:* $g(x) = \frac{x^2-4}{x-2}$. Limit is 4, but undefined at $x=2$. Can be "removed" by defining $g(2)=4$.
* **Jump Discontinuity:** $f(p+) \neq f(p-)$.
    * *Example:* The greatest integer function $f(x) = [x]$. At integer $n$:
        * $f(n-) = n-1$
        * $f(n+) = n$
        * Jump size is 1.

**2. Discontinuities of the Second Kind**
Either $f(p+)$ or $f(p-)$ (or both) does not exist.
* *Example:* $f(x) = \sin(\frac{1}{x})$ for $x > 0$ and $f(x)=0$ for $x \le 0$.
    * $f(0-) = 0$.
    * $f(0+)$ does not exist (oscillates between -1 and 1).

**3. Specific Examples Analyzed**
* **Example 4.4.5(a):** Piecewise function defined as $x$ for $x \le 1$ and $3-x^2$ for $x > 1$.
    * $f(1-) = 1$, $f(1+) = 2$.
    * Left continuous, but jump discontinuity at $x=1$.
* **Example 4.4.5(d):** $g(x) = \sin(2\pi x [x])$.
    * Continuous on $(n, n+1)$ as $[x]$ is constant $n$.
    * At integers $n$, limits from both sides go to 0, so it is continuous at integers.
    * However, it is not *uniformly* continuous on $\mathbb{R}$.

### **III. Monotone Functions**

**1. Definitions**
Let $f$ be defined on interval $I$.
* **Monotone Increasing:** $x < y \implies f(x) \le f(y)$.
* **Monotone Decreasing:** $x < y \implies f(x) \ge f(y)$.
* **Strictly Increasing:** $x < y \implies f(x) < f(y)$.

**2. Theorem 4.4.7 (Existence of Limits)**
If $f$ is monotone increasing on an open interval $I$, then for every $p \in I$, both $f(p+)$ and $f(p-)$ exist. The following inequality holds:
$$\sup_{x<p} f(x) = f(p-) \le f(p) \le f(p+) = \inf_{x>p} f(x)$$
* Furthermore, if $p < q$, then $f(p+) \le f(q-)$.

**3. Corollary 4.4.8 (Countability of Discontinuities)**
The set of discontinuities of a monotone function is **at most countable**.
* *Proof logic:* Each discontinuity is a jump $(f(p-), f(p+))$. Since intervals are disjoint for distinct points, we can map each jump to a rational number within that interval. Since $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable, the set of jumps is countable.

---

### **IV. Construction of Functions with Prescribed Discontinuities**

We can construct a monotone function that is discontinuous exactly at a specific countable set of points.

**1. The Unit Jump Function $I(x)$**
$$I(x) = \begin{cases} 0 & x < 0 \\ 1 & x \ge 0 \end{cases}$$
* $I(x)$ is right continuous.
* Shifted: $I(x-a)$ has a jump at $a$.

**2. Theorem 4.4.10 (General Construction)**
Let $\{x_n\}$ be a countable subset of $(a,b)$. Let $\{c_n\}$ be a sequence of positive numbers such that $\sum c_n$ converges.
Define:
$$f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} c_n I(x - x_n)$$
**Properties of $f$:**
* **Monotone Increasing:** Since $c_n > 0$ and $I$ is increasing.
* **Continuous:** At all $x \in [a,b] \setminus \{x_n\}$.
* **Discontinuous:** At each $x_n$, with jump magnitude $f(x_n) - f(x_n-) = c_n$.
* **Right Continuous:** Everywhere (including $x_n$).

**3. Examples of Construction**
* **Step Function:** If $\{x_n\}$ is finite, $f$ is a standard step function.
* **Rational Discontinuities:** Let $\{x_n\}$ be an enumeration of $\mathbb{Q} \cap (0,1)$. The resulting function is strictly increasing, discontinuous at every rational, and continuous at every irrational.
* **Distribution Functions:** If $\sum c_n = 1$, $f$ resembles a cumulative distribution function (CDF) in probability.

### **V. Inverse Functions**

**1. Logic of Invertibility**
* Strictly monotone $\implies$ One-to-one (Injective).
* One-to-one functions have an inverse $f^{-1}$ defined on their range.

**2. Theorem 4.4.12 (Continuity of Inverse)**
Let $f: I \to \mathbb{R}$ be strictly monotone and continuous on an interval $I$.
Let $J = f(I)$.
Then:
1.  $J$ is an interval (by Intermediate Value Theorem).
2.  $f^{-1}: J \to I$ is **strictly monotone** (same direction as $f$).
3.  $f^{-1}$ is **continuous** on $J$.

**3. Example 4.4.13 ($n$-th Roots)**
* $f(x) = x^n$ is strictly increasing and continuous on $[0, \infty)$.
* Therefore, the inverse function $g(x) = \sqrt[n]{x}$ is strictly increasing and continuous on $[0, \infty)$.

**4. Remark (Converse)**
If $f$ is one-to-one and continuous on an interval $I$, then $f$ must be strictly monotone. (This fails if the domain is not an interval).
