# **Chapter 5.2: The Mean Value Thm.**

## 1. Local Maxima and Minima

**Definition 5.2.1:**
A function $f: E \to \mathbb{R}$ has a:
* **Local maximum** at $p \in E$ if $\exists \delta > 0$ such that $f(x) \le f(p)$ for all $x \in E \cap N_\delta(p)$.
* **Absolute maximum** if $f(x) \le f(p)$ for all $x \in E$.
(Analogous definitions apply for minimums).

**Theorem 5.2.2 (Relationship to Derivative):**
Let $f$ be defined on interval $I$. If $f$ has a local extremum at an interior point $p \in \text{Int}(I)$ and $f$ is differentiable at $p$, then:
$$f'(p) = 0$$

* **Proof Idea:** Analyze the difference quotient. If $p$ is a max, $\frac{f(t)-f(p)}{t-p} \le 0$ for $t>p$ (implies $f'_+(p) \le 0$) and $\ge 0$ for $t<p$ (implies $f'_-(p) \ge 0$). Since $f'(p)$ exists, limits must be equal, thus $0$.

**Corollary 5.2.3:**
For continuous $f$ on $[a, b]$, relative extrema at $p \in (a,b)$ imply either $f'(p)$ does not exist or $f'(p)=0$.
* *Note:* This does not apply to endpoints. At endpoints, we can only conclude inequality (e.g., if max at $a$, $f'(a) \le 0$).

## 2. Rolle's Theorem

**Theorem 5.2.5 (Rolle's Theorem):**
Suppose $f$ is:
1.  Continuous on $[a, b]$
2.  Differentiable on $(a, b)$
3.  $f(a) = f(b)$

Then there exists $c \in (a, b)$ such that $f'(c) = 0$.

* **Geometric Interpretation:** There is at least one point where the tangent line is horizontal.
* **Proof Idea:**
    * Since $[a,b]$ is compact, $f$ attains max and min (EVT).
    * If $f$ is constant, $f'(x)=0$ everywhere.
    * If not constant, extremum occurs at an interior point $c$. By Theorem 5.2.2, $f'(c)=0$.
* **Example:** $f(x) = \sqrt{4-x^2}$ on $[-2, 2]$. Derivative undefined at endpoints, but theorem holds ($c=0$).

## 3. The Mean Value Theorem (MVT)

**Theorem 5.2.6 (Lagrange):**
Suppose $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ and differentiable on $(a, b)$. Then there exists $c \in (a, b)$ such that:
$$f(b) - f(a) = f'(c)(b - a)$$

* **Geometric Interpretation:** There is a point $c$ where the tangent slope equals the secant slope connecting $(a, f(a))$ and $(b, f(b))$.
* **Proof Idea:**
    Construct an auxiliary function $g(x)$ representing the vertical distance between the curve and the secant line:
    $$g(x) = f(x) - f(a) - \left[ \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} \right](x-a)$$
    Since $g(a) = g(b) = 0$, applying Rolle's Theorem to $g$ yields $g'(c)=0$, which rearranges to the MVT equation.

**Example 5.2.7 (Inequalities):**
Using MVT to prove $\frac{x}{1+x} \le \ln(1+x) \le x$ for $x > -1$.
* Let $f(x) = \ln(1+x)$. $f(0)=0$.
* By MVT, $\ln(1+x) = f(x) - f(0) = f'(c)x = \frac{x}{1+c}$ for some $c$ between 0 and $x$.
* Analyze bounds of $\frac{1}{1+c}$ based on $0 < c < x$ or $x < c < 0$ to derive the inequality.

## 4. Cauchy Mean Value Theorem

**Theorem 5.2.8:**
If $f, g$ are continuous on $[a, b]$ and differentiable on $(a, b)$, then there exists $c \in (a, b)$ such that:
$$[f(b) - f(a)]g'(c) = [g(b) - g(a)]f'(c)$$
If $g'(x) \neq 0$, this can be written as:
$$\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)} = \frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)}$$

* **Proof Idea:** Define $h(x) = [f(b)-f(a)]g(x) - [g(b)-g(a)]f(x)$. Since $h(a)=h(b)$, apply Rolle's Theorem to find $h'(c)=0$.
* **Geometric Interpretation:** For a parametric curve defined by $(g(t), f(t))$, there is a point where the tangent slope equals the slope of the chord connecting the endpoints.

## 5. Applications: Monotonicity

### 1. Monotonicity on Intervals (Theorem 5.2.9)
Let $f$ be differentiable on an interval $I$. The sign of the derivative determines the monotonicity of the function on that interval:

* $f'(x) \ge 0, \ \forall x \in I \implies f$ is **monotone increasing**.
* $f'(x) > 0, \ \forall x \in I \implies f$ is **strictly increasing**.
* $f'(x) \le 0, \ \forall x \in I \implies f$ is **monotone decreasing**.
* $f'(x) = 0, \ \forall x \in I \implies f$ is **constant**.

 **Proof Idea:** Apply the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) to arbitrary $x_1 < x_2$. The sign of $f(x_2) - f(x_1)$ is determined entirely by $f'(c)(x_2 - x_1)$.

### 2. Pointwise vs. Neighborhood Behavior (Crucial Distinction)

**Observation:**
The condition $f'(c) > 0$ at a **single point** $c$ behaves differently than $f'(x) > 0$ on an **interval**.

**A. What $f'(c) > 0$ implies:**
If $f'(c) > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that:
* $f(x) < f(c)$ for all $x \in (c - \delta, c)$
* $f(x) > f(c)$ for all $x \in (c, c + \delta)$
*(See Exercise 17)*.

**B. What $f'(c) > 0$ does NOT imply:**
It does **not** imply that $f$ is increasing on the interval $(c-\delta, c+\delta)$.
* **Reason:** $f'(x)$ may assume both positive and negative values in every neighborhood of $c$.
* **Counter-Example (Exercise 20):**
    $$f(x) = \begin{cases} x + 2x^2 \sin(1/x) & x \neq 0 \\ 0 & x = 0 \end{cases}$$
    Here, $f'(0) = 1 > 0$, yet $f$ is **not monotone** on any interval containing 0 due to rapid oscillation.

**C. Sufficient Condition for Monotonicity:**
If we require **continuity** of the derivative:
* If $f'(c) > 0$ **AND** $f'$ is continuous at $c$, then there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \in (c-\delta, c+\delta)$.
* $\therefore f$ is increasing on $(c-\delta, c+\delta)$.

### 3. Relative Extrema & The First Derivative Test

**The First Derivative Test:**
Used to classify critical points where $f'(c) = 0$ or $f'(c)$ does not exist.
Suppose $f$ is continuous on $(a, b)$.
1.  If $f'(x) < 0$ on $(a, c)$ AND $f'(x) > 0$ on $(c, b)$:
    * $f$ is decreasing to the left and increasing to the right.
    * $\implies f$ has a **relative minimum** at $c$.
2.  (Similarly for relative maximum if signs switch from $+$ to $-$).

**The False Converse:**
One naturally assumes: *"If $f$ has a relative minimum at $c$, then $f$ must be decreasing to the left and increasing to the right."*
* **This is FALSE.**
* A function can have a relative minimum at $c$ without being monotone on the immediate left or right sides.



**Counter-Example (Example 5.2.10):**
$$f(x) = \begin{cases} x^4(2+\sin(1/x)) & x \neq 0 \\ 0 & x = 0 \end{cases}$$
* $f$ has an absolute minimum at $x=0$ (since $f(x) > 0$ for $x \neq 0$).
* However, $f'(x)$ oscillates between positive and negative values in every neighborhood of 0.
* Thus, $f$ is **not** "decreasing then increasing" in the standard monotonic sense near 0.

## 6. Limits of Derivatives

**Theorem 5.2.11:**
If $f$ is continuous on $[a, b)$ and differentiable on $(a, b)$, and $\lim_{x \to a^+} f'(x) = L$, then the right-hand derivative exists and:
$$f'_+(a) = \lim_{x \to a^+} f'(x)$$

* **Proof Idea:** Use MVT on $[a, a+h]$. $f(a+h) - f(a) = f'(\zeta_h)h$. As $h \to 0$, $\zeta_h \to a$, so the difference quotient converges to $L$.
* **Implication:** Derivatives cannot have simple jump discontinuities; discontinuities must be of the second kind (oscillatory).

## 7. Intermediate Value Theorem for Derivatives

**Theorem 5.2.13 (Darboux's Theorem):**
If $f$ is differentiable on $I$ and $a, b \in I$ with $a < b$, then for any $\lambda$ between $f'(a)$ and $f'(b)$, there exists $c \in (a, b)$ such that:
$$f'(c) = \lambda$$

* **Significance:** Derivatives possess the Intermediate Value Property even if they are **not continuous**.
* **Proof Idea:** Construct $g(x) = f(x) - \lambda x$. Depending on signs of $g'(a)$ and $g'(b)$, $g$ attains a local extremum interior to the interval. At that extremum $c$, $g'(c) = f'(c) - \lambda = 0$.

---

## 8. Inverse Function Theorem

**Theorem 5.2.14:**
If $f$ is differentiable on interval $I$ and $f'(x) \neq 0$ for all $x \in I$:
1.  $f$ is one-to-one.
2.  $f^{-1}$ is continuous and differentiable on $J = f(I)$.
3.  The derivative is given by:
    $$(f^{-1})'(f(x)) = \frac{1}{f'(x)}$$

* **Proof Idea:** $f' \neq 0$ implies $f'$ maintains a single sign (by Darboux's Theorem), so $f$ is strictly monotone (one-to-one). Differentiability follows from limits.
