# **Section 4.3: Uniform Continuity**

### **1. Concept: Pointwise vs. Uniform Continuity**

* **Standard Continuity (Pointwise):**
    * A function $f: E \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous on $E$ if for each $p \in E$ and $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that $|f(x) - f(p)| < \epsilon$ for all $x \in E \cap N_\delta(p)$.
    * **Dependency:** Here, $\delta$ depends on **both** $\epsilon$ and the specific point $p$. (i.e., $\delta = \delta(\epsilon, p)$).
    * *Problem:* As $p$ changes, the required $\delta$ might get infinitely small (e.g., $f(x) = 1/x$ near $0$).

* **Uniform Continuity (Definition 4.3.1):**
    * Let $E \subset (X, d)$ and $f: E \to \mathbb{R}$.
    * $f$ is **uniformly continuous** on $E$ if:
        $$\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0 \text{ such that } \forall x, y \in E, \text{ if } d(x, y) < \delta \implies |f(x) - f(y)| < \epsilon$$
    * **Dependency:** Here, $\delta$ depends **only** on $\epsilon$, $f$, and the set $E$. It is **independent** of the point $x$.

### **2. Examples of Uniform Continuity**

#### **Case A: $f(x) = x^2$ on a Bounded Subset $E$**
* **Claim:** $f$ is uniformly continuous on $E$ if $E$ is bounded.
* **Proof:**
    * Since $E$ is bounded, $\exists C > 0$ such that $|x| \le C$ for all $x \in E$.
    * Consider $|f(x) - f(y)| = |x^2 - y^2| = |x+y||x-y|$.
    * Using the bound: $|x+y| \le |x| + |y| \le 2C$.
    * Thus, $|f(x) - f(y)| \le 2C|x-y|$.
    * Choose $\delta = \epsilon / 2C$. If $|x-y| < \delta$, then $|f(x) - f(y)| < \epsilon$.

#### **Case B: $f(x) = \sin x$ on $\mathbb{R}$**
* **Claim:** $f$ is uniformly continuous on $\mathbb{R}$.
* **Proof:**
    * Standard trigonometric inequality: $|\sin x - \sin y| \le |x - y|$.
    * Choose $\delta = \epsilon$.
    * If $|x-y| < \delta$, then $|f(x) - f(y)| \le |x-y| < \epsilon$.

#### **Case C: Non-Example ($f(x) = 1/x$ on $(0, 1)$)**
* **Claim:** $f$ is **not** uniformly continuous on $(0, 1)$.
* **Proof (Contradiction):**
    * Assume $f$ is uniformly continuous. Let $\epsilon = 1$.
    * There must exist $\delta > 0$ (assume $\delta < 1$) such that $|x-y| < \delta \implies |1/x - 1/y| < 1$.
    * Choose $x \in (0, 1/2)$ such that $x$ is very small, and let $y = x + \delta/2$.
    * Then $|x-y| = \delta/2 < \delta$.
    * However, analysis shows that as $x \to 0$, the difference $|1/x - 1/(x+\delta/2)|$ becomes arbitrarily large, eventually exceeding 1.
    * Specifically, if $x$ is small enough ($x < \delta/2$), the inequality fails, leading to a contradiction.

### **3. Lipschitz Functions**

* **Definition:** A function $f: E \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfies a **Lipschitz condition** on $E$ if there exists a constant $M > 0$ such that:
    $$|f(x) - f(y)| \le M d(x, y) \quad \forall x, y \in E$$
    * These are called Lipschitz functions.
    * Functions with bounded derivatives are Lipschitz.

* **Theorem 4.3.3:**
    * If $f$ satisfies a Lipschitz condition on $E$, then $f$ is **uniformly continuous** on $E$.
    * *Proof Logic:* Simply choose $\delta = \epsilon / M$.

* **Important Note (Converse is False):**
    * Not every uniformly continuous function is Lipschitz.
    * *Example:* $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ on $[0, \infty)$ is uniformly continuous, but **not** Lipschitz (the derivative is unbounded near 0).

### **4. The Uniform Continuity Theorem**

Determining uniform continuity for non-Lipschitz functions is difficult. Compactness provides a sufficient condition.

* **Theorem 4.3.4:**
    * If $K$ is a **compact** metric space and $f: K \to \mathbb{R}$ is **continuous** on $K$, then $f$ is **uniformly continuous** on $K$.

* **Proof Sketch:**
    1.  Fix $\epsilon > 0$. Since $f$ is continuous, for every $p \in K$, there is a $\delta_p$ valid locally.
    2.  The neighborhoods $N_{\delta_p/2}(p)$ form an open cover of $K$.
    3.  Since $K$ is compact, there is a **finite subcover** corresponding to points $p_1, \dots, p_n$.
    4.  Define $\delta = \frac{1}{2} \min \{ \delta_{p_1}, \dots, \delta_{p_n} \}$. This $\delta$ works globally for the whole set.

* **Corollary 4.3.5 (Heine's Theorem):**
    * A continuous real-valued function on a **closed and bounded interval** $[a, b]$ is uniformly continuous.

### **5. Necessity of Compactness (Example 4.3.6)**

To guarantee uniform continuity via Theorem 4.3.4, the domain must be **both** closed and bounded (Compact).

* **Closed but Not Bounded:**
    * Set: $[0, \infty)$.
    * Function: $f(x) = x^2$.
    * Result: Continuous, but **not** uniformly continuous (values grow too fast as $x \to \infty$).

* **Bounded but Not Closed:**
    * Set: $(0, 1)$.
    * Function: $f(x) = 1/x$.
    * Result: Continuous, but **not** uniformly continuous (values grow too fast as $x \to 0$).
