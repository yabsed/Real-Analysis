# **Section 4.4: Monotone Functions and Discontinuities**

### **I. Right and Left Limits**

**1. Definitions**
Let $E \subset \mathbb{R}$ and $f: E \to \mathbb{R}$.
* **Right Limit ($f(p+)$):** Suppose $p$ is a limit point of $E \cap (p, \infty)$.
    $$\lim_{x \to p^+} f(x) = L \iff \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0 \text{ such that } |f(x) - L| < \epsilon \text{ whenever } p < x < p + \delta.$$
* **Left Limit ($f(p-)$):** Suppose $p$ is a limit point of $E \cap (-\infty, p)$.
    $$\lim_{x \to p^-} f(x) = L \iff \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0 \text{ such that } |f(x) - L| < \epsilon \text{ whenever } p - \delta < x < p.$$

**2. Relationship to General Limits**
For $p \in \text{Int}(I)$, $\lim_{x \to p} f(x)$ exists if and only if:
1.  Both $f(p+)$ and $f(p-)$ exist.
2.  $f(p+) = f(p-)$.

**3. One-Sided Continuity**
* **Right Continuous at $p$:** $\lim_{x \to p^+} f(x) = f(p)$.
* **Left Continuous at $p$:** $\lim_{x \to p^-} f(x) = f(p)$.
* **Theorem 4.4.3:** $f$ is continuous at $p$ iff $f(p+) = f(p-) = f(p)$.

### **II. Classification of Discontinuities**

If $f$ is discontinuous at $p$, it falls into one of two main categories:

**1. Simple Discontinuities (First Kind)**
Both $f(p+)$ and $f(p-)$ exist.
* **Removable Discontinuity:** $f(p+)$ and $f(p-)$ exist and are equal, but differ from $f(p)$ (or $f(p)$ is undefined).
    * *Example:* $g(x) = \frac{x^2-4}{x-2}$. Limit is 4, but undefined at $x=2$. Can be "removed" by defining $g(2)=4$.
* **Jump Discontinuity:** $f(p+) \neq f(p-)$.
    * *Example:* The greatest integer function $f(x) = [x]$. At integer $n$:
        * $f(n-) = n-1$
        * $f(n+) = n$
        * Jump size is 1.

**2. Discontinuities of the Second Kind**
Either $f(p+)$ or $f(p-)$ (or both) does not exist.
* *Example:* $f(x) = \sin(\frac{1}{x})$ for $x > 0$ and $f(x)=0$ for $x \le 0$.
    * $f(0-) = 0$.
    * $f(0+)$ does not exist (oscillates between -1 and 1).

**3. Specific Examples Analyzed**
* **Example 4.4.5(a):** Piecewise function defined as $x$ for $x \le 1$ and $3-x^2$ for $x > 1$.
    * $f(1-) = 1$, $f(1+) = 2$.
    * Left continuous, but jump discontinuity at $x=1$.
* **Example 4.4.5(d):** $g(x) = \sin(2\pi x [x])$.
    * Continuous on $(n, n+1)$ as $[x]$ is constant $n$.
    * At integers $n$, limits from both sides go to 0, so it is continuous at integers.
    * However, it is not *uniformly* continuous on $\mathbb{R}$.

### III. Monotone Functions

**1. Definitions**
Let $f$ be defined on an interval $I$.
* **Monotone Increasing:** $x < y \implies f(x) \le f(y)$.
* **Monotone Decreasing:** $x < y \implies f(x) \ge f(y)$.
* **Strictly Increasing:** $x < y \implies f(x) < f(y)$.

**2. Theorem 4.4.7 (Existence of Limits)**

If $f$ is monotone increasing on an open interval $I$, then for every $p \in I$, both $f(p+)$ and $f(p-)$ exist. The following inequality holds:
$$\sup_{x<p} f(x) = f(p-) \le f(p) \le f(p+) = \inf_{x>p} f(x)$$
Furthermore, if $p < q$, then $f(p+) \le f(q-)$.

**Proof of Theorem 4.4.7**

* **Part 1: Existence of Left Limit $f(p-)$**

    Let $S = \{f(x) : x < p\}$. Since $f$ is monotonic increasing, $f(p)$ serves as an upper bound for $S$.
    * By the **Completeness Property**, the supremum $A = \sup S$ exists, and clearly $A \le f(p)$.
    * **Convergence:** For any $\epsilon > 0$, since $A$ is the least upper bound, $A - \epsilon$ is not an upper bound. Thus, there exists $x_0 < p$ such that $A - \epsilon < f(x_0) \le A$.
    * By monotonicity, for all $x \in (x_0, p)$, we have $f(x_0) \le f(x) \le A$.
    * Consequently, $|f(x) - A| < \epsilon$, which implies $f(p-) = A \le f(p)$.

* **Part 2: Existence of Right Limit $f(p+)$**

    By an analogous argument using the **infimum** of the set $\{f(x) : x > p\}$, we establish that the right limit exists and satisfies:
    $$f(p) \le f(p+) = \inf_{x>p} f(x)$$

* **Part 3: Relation for distinct points ($p < q$)**

    Let $p < q$. Choose any $x$ such that $p < x < q$.
    From the definitions of the one-sided limits established above:
    $$f(p+) = \inf_{z>p} f(z) \le f(x) \le \sup_{z<q} f(z) = f(q-)$$

**3. Corollary 4.4.8 (Countability of Discontinuities)**

The set of discontinuities of a monotone function is **at most countable**.

* *Proof Logic:* Each discontinuity is a jump $(f(p-), f(p+))$. Since intervals are disjoint for distinct points, we can map each jump to a rational number within that interval. Since $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable, the set of jumps is countable.

### **IV. Construction of Functions with Prescribed Discontinuities**

We can construct a monotone function that is discontinuous exactly at a specific countable set of points, with controlled jump sizes.

**1. The Unit Jump Function $I(x)$**
$$I(x) = \begin{cases} 0 & x < 0 \\ 1 & x \ge 0 \end{cases}$$
* The function $I(x)$ is **right continuous** at 0 with a unit jump: $I(0+)=1$ and $I(0-)=0$.
* **Shifted Function:** $I_k(x) = I(x - a_k)$ represents a unit step occurring strictly at $x = a_k$.

**2. Theorem 4.4.10 (General Construction)**
Let $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a countable subset of $(a, b)$. Let $\{c_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence of positive real numbers such that the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} c_n$ converges.

Define the function $f$ on $[a, b]$ by:
$$f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} c_n I(x - x_n)$$

**Detailed Analysis of $f$:**

* **Well-Defined and Monotone:**
    Since $0 \le c_n I(x - x_n) \le c_n$, the partial sums $s_n(x)$ are bounded above by $\sum c_n$. Thus, $f(x)$ converges for all $x$. Furthermore, because each term $I(x - x_n)$ is non-decreasing, $f$ is **monotone increasing** on $[a, b]$.
    * Boundary values: $f(a) = 0$ (since $x_n > a$) and $f(b) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} c_n$.

* **Continuity on $[a, b] \setminus \{x_n\}$:**
    The function is continuous at any point $p$ where $p \ne x_n$ for any $n$. The proof relies on splitting the set of points $E = \{x_n\}$:
    * **Isolated Points:** If $p$ is not a limit point of $E$, there exists a neighborhood $(p-\delta, p+\delta)$ containing no $x_n$. In this interval, $f$ is constant, and therefore continuous.
    * **Limit Points:** If $p$ is a limit point of $E$, continuity is proved using the Cauchy criterion. For any $\epsilon > 0$, we can choose an integer $N$ such that the "tail" of the series is small ($\sum_{k=N+1}^{\infty} c_k < \epsilon$). By choosing a neighborhood $\delta$ small enough to exclude the first $N$ points, the variation of $f$ near $p$ is bounded by $\epsilon$, proving continuity.

* **Right Continuity Everywhere:**
    For any point $x_n$ (or any $p$), $f$ is right continuous:
    $$f(x_n+) = f(x_n)$$
    This is because as $x \to x_n$ from the right, the terms $I(x-x_k)$ do not change state (they remain 1 for $x_k \le x_n$ and 0 for $x_k > x$ locally). The variation is again controlled by the tail of the convergent series $\sum c_n$.

* **Discontinuity at $\{x_n\}$:**
    At each prescribed point $x_n$, the function exhibits a jump discontinuity exactly equal to the weight $c_n$:
    $$f(x_n) - f(x_n-) = c_n$$
    * **Left Limit:** As $y \to x_n$ from the left ($y < x_n$), the term $c_n I(y - x_n)$ is $0$.
    * **Value at $x_n$:** Exactly at $x_n$, the term becomes $c_n I(0) = c_n$.
    * This confirms that $f$ has a countable number of discontinuities strictly located at the set $\{x_n\}$.

**3. Examples of Construction**
* **Step Function:** If $\{x_n\}$ is a finite set, $f$ is a standard step function with finitely many jumps.
* **Rational Discontinuities:** Let $\{x_n\}$ be an enumeration of the rational numbers $\mathbb{Q} \cap (0,1)$ and $c_n = 2^{-n}$. The resulting function is strictly increasing, discontinuous at every rational number in $(0,1)$, and continuous at every irrational number.
* **Distribution Functions:** If the weights are normalized such that $\sum c_n = 1$, the function behaves like a cumulative distribution function (CDF) used in probability theory.

### **V. Inverse Functions**

**1. Logic of Invertibility**
* **Strict Monotonicity:** Let $f$ be a strictly increasing real-valued function on an interval $I$. If $x, y \in I$ with $x < y$, then $f(x) < f(y)$. The same logic applies if $f$ is strictly decreasing.
* **Injectivity (One-to-One):** Strictly monotone functions imply that $f(x) \neq f(y)$ for any distinct $x, y \in I$. Therefore, $f$ is one-to-one.
* **Existence:** Because $f$ is one-to-one, it possesses an inverse function $f^{-1}$ defined on the range $f(I)$.

**2. Theorem 4.4.12: Continuity of the Inverse Function**
* **Statement:** Let $I \subset \mathbb{R}$ be an interval and let $f: I \to \mathbb{R}$ be strictly monotone and continuous on $I$. Then the inverse function $f^{-1}$ is strictly monotone and continuous on the interval $J = f(I)$.
* **Proof Summary:**
    1.  **Image is an Interval:** Since $f$ is continuous on the interval $I$, the image $J = f(I)$ must also be an interval (by Corollary 4.2.12).
    2.  **Monotonicity of Inverse:** If $f$ is strictly increasing, $f^{-1}$ is also strictly increasing. For $y_1, y_2 \in J$ with $y_1 < y_2$, their pre-images must satisfy $x_1 < x_2$.
    3.  **Continuity of Inverse:** To prove $f^{-1}$ is continuous at $y_0 \in J$:
        * Consider an $\epsilon$-neighborhood around $x_0 = f^{-1}(y_0)$.
        * Due to the strict monotonicity and continuity of $f$, we can map the interval $(x_0 - \epsilon, x_0]$ to $(y_0 - \delta, y_0]$ where $\delta = f(x_0) - f(x_0 - \epsilon)$.
        * This ensures that for $y$ within $\delta$ of $y_0$, $|f^{-1}(y_0) - f^{-1}(y)| < \epsilon$, proving continuity.

**3. Example 4.4.13 ($n$-th Roots)**
* $f(x) = x^n$ is strictly increasing and continuous on $I = [0, \infty)$.
* Therefore, the inverse $g(x) = \sqrt[n]{x}$ is strictly increasing and continuous on $J = [0, \infty)$.

**4. Remark (Conditions for Monotonicity)**
* **The Converse:** If $f$ is one-to-one and continuous on an interval $I$, then $f$ is necessarily strictly monotone (increasing or decreasing). This results from the Intermediate Value Theorem.
* **Essential Conditions:** This converse holds **only** if:
    1.  $f$ is continuous.
    2.  The domain of $f$ is an interval.
    
    If either condition is unmet, a one-to-one function might not be strictly monotone.
