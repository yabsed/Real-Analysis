# 7.2 The Dirichlet Test and Applications

## 1. Abel Partial Summation Formula
This formula is the discrete analogue of **Integration by Parts**. It is the fundamental tool required to prove the Dirichlet Test.

**Theorem 7.2.1**
Let $\{a_k\}$ and $\{b_k\}$ be sequences of real numbers.
Define partial sums $A_0 = 0$ and $A_n = \sum_{k=1}^n a_k$ for $n \ge 1$.
If $1 \le p \le q$, then:
$$\sum_{k=p}^{q} a_k b_k = \sum_{k=p}^{q-1} A_k (b_k - b_{k+1}) + A_q b_q - A_{p-1} b_p$$

**Proof (Key Idea):**
We substitute $a_k$ using the difference of partial sums: $a_k = A_k - A_{k-1}$.
$$\sum_{k=p}^{q} a_k b_k = \sum_{k=p}^{q} (A_k - A_{k-1})b_k = \sum_{k=p}^{q} A_k b_k - \sum_{k=p}^{q} A_{k-1} b_k$$
By shifting the index of the second summation (letting $j = k-1$), we align the terms to factor out $A_k$. The middle terms collapse into the form $A_k(b_k - b_{k+1})$, leaving the boundary terms $A_q b_q$ and $-A_{p-1} b_p$.

## 2. The Dirichlet Test
This test provides convergence criteria for series of the form $\sum a_k b_k$, usually where one part oscillates and the other decays.

**Theorem 7.2.2**
The series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k b_k$ converges if the sequences satisfy three conditions:
1.  **Bounded Partial Sums:** The sequence $A_n = \sum_{k=1}^n a_k$ is bounded (i.e., $|A_n| \le M$ for some $M > 0$).
2.  **Monotonicity:** $\{b_k\}$ is decreasing ($b_1 \ge b_2 \ge \dots \ge 0$).
3.  **Limit Zero:** $\lim_{k \to \infty} b_k = 0$.

**Proof (Key Idea):**
We use the **Cauchy Criterion**. We need to show that for large enough $p, q$, the tail sum $|\sum_{k=p}^q a_k b_k|$ is arbitrarily small.
Using Abel's Formula and the triangle inequality:
$$\left| \sum_{k=p}^{q} a_k b_k \right| \le \sum_{k=p}^{q-1} |A_k|(b_k - b_{k+1}) + |A_q|b_q + |A_{p-1}|b_p$$
Since $|A_k| \le M$ and terms $(b_k - b_{k+1})$ are non-negative (because $b_k$ is decreasing):
$$\le M \left[ \sum_{k=p}^{q-1} (b_k - b_{k+1}) + b_q + b_p \right]$$
The summation inside is a telescoping sum that simplifies to $b_p - b_q$. Thus, the expression simplifies to $2M b_p$. Since $b_p \to 0$, this value becomes smaller than any $\epsilon$, proving convergence.

## 3. Application I: Alternating Series
The most common application of the Dirichlet Test is for alternating series.

**Theorem 7.2.3 (Alternating Series Test)**
If $\{b_k\}$ satisfies $b_1 \ge b_2 \ge \dots \ge 0$ and $\lim_{k \to \infty} b_k = 0$, then:
$$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{k+1} b_k \quad \text{converges.}$$

**Proof:**
Set $a_k = (-1)^{k+1}$. The partial sums $A_n$ alternate between $1$ and $0$. Thus, $|A_n| \le 1$ for all $n$. Since partial sums are bounded and $\{b_k\}$ decreases to zero, the Dirichlet Test applies directly.

### Error Estimation
For alternating series, we can easily bound the error between the limit $s$ and the partial sum $s_n$.

**Theorem 7.2.4**
Let $s = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{k+1} b_k$ and $s_n$ be the $n$-th partial sum. Then:
$$|s - s_n| \le b_{n+1}$$

**Proof (Key Idea):**
* Consider the even partial sums $\{s_{2n}\}$. Because $s_{2n} = (b_1 - b_2) + \dots + (b_{2n-1} - b_{2n})$ and terms are decreasing, $\{s_{2n}\}$ is **increasing**.
* Similarly, $\{s_{2n+1}\}$ is **decreasing**.
* Since the series converges to $s$, the limit is "trapped" between consecutive partial sums: $s_{2n} \le s \le s_{2n+1}$.
* The distance between consecutive sums is $|s_{k+1} - s_k| = b_{k+1}$. Therefore, the distance from $s_k$ to $s$ cannot exceed $b_{k+1}$.

**Example 7.2.5**
Consider the series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{2k-1}$.
* Since $\{ \frac{1}{2k-1} \}$ decreases to 0, the series converges.
* (Note: It converges to $\pi/4$).
* **Error:** By Theorem 7.2.4, $|\frac{\pi}{4} - s_n| \le \frac{1}{2n+1}$.
* **Result:** Convergence is very slow. To get 2 decimal places of accuracy ($< 0.01$), we need $2n+1 > 100$, implying $n \approx 50$.

## 4. Application II: Trigonometric Series
We examine series of the form $\sum b_k \sin(kt)$ and $\sum b_k \cos(kt)$.

**Theorem 7.2.6**
Let $\{b_k\}$ be a sequence where $b_1 \ge b_2 \ge \dots \ge 0$ and $\lim_{k \to \infty} b_k = 0$.
1.  **Sine Series:** $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} b_k \sin(kt)$ converges for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$.
2.  **Cosine Series:** $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} b_k \cos(kt)$ converges for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, **except** possibly where $t = 2p\pi$ for integers $p$.

**Proof (Key Idea):**
We must prove that the partial sums of the trigonometric parts ($a_k = \sin kt$ or $\cos kt$) are bounded.
Key Identity for partial sums of sine (for $t \neq 2p\pi$):
$$A_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \sin kt = \frac{\cos \frac{1}{2}t - \cos(n+\frac{1}{2})t}{2 \sin \frac{1}{2}t}$$
**Bounding $A_n$:**
$$|A_n| \le \frac{|\cos \frac{1}{2}t| + |\cos(n+\frac{1}{2})t|}{2 |\sin \frac{1}{2}t|} \le \frac{2}{2 |\sin \frac{1}{2}t|} = \frac{1}{|\sin \frac{1}{2}t|}$$
This is a finite constant for any fixed $t \neq 2p\pi$.
* Since $A_n$ is bounded and $b_k \downarrow 0$, the **Dirichlet Test** proves convergence.
* **Case $t = 2p\pi$:**
    * For sine: $\sin(k \cdot 2p\pi) = 0$. The sum is $\sum 0$, which converges.
    * For cosine: $\cos(k \cdot 2p\pi) = 1$. The sum becomes $\sum b_k$. Since we only know $b_k \to 0$, this might diverge (e.g., if $b_k = 1/k$).

**Example 7.2.7**
1.  **Series:** $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k} \cos kt$
    * Converges for all $t \neq 2p\pi$ (by Theorem 7.2.6).
    * If $t = 2p\pi$, series becomes $\sum \frac{1}{k}$ (Harmonic Series), which **diverges**.
2.  **Series:** $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^2} \cos kt$
    * Converges for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$.
    * Even at $t = 2p\pi$, it becomes $\sum \frac{1}{k^2}$, which converges ($p$-series, $p=2$).
