# Study Notes: Series of Real Numbers
## 1. Absolute and Conditional Convergence

### Definitions
* **Absolute Convergence:** A series $\sum a_{k}$ is absolutely convergent if the series of absolute values $\sum|a_{k}|$ converges.
* **Conditional Convergence:** A series is conditionally convergent if $\sum a_{k}$ converges, but $\sum|a_{k}|$ diverges.

### Examples
1.  **Alternating Harmonic Series:** $\sum \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k}$
    * Converges (by Alternating Series Test).
    * However, $\sum |\frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k}| = \sum \frac{1}{k} = \infty$ (Harmonic series diverges).
    * $\therefore$ **Conditionally Convergent**.
2.  **Inverse Square Alternating Series:** $\sum \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k^2}$
    * $\sum \frac{1}{k^2} < \infty$.
    * $\therefore$ **Absolutely Convergent**.

### Theorem 7.3.3: Absolute Implies Convergence
**Statement:** Every absolutely convergent series converges.
**Proof Idea:**
* Assume $\sum |a_k| < \infty$.
* By the **Triangle Inequality**: $|\sum_{k=p}^{q} a_{k}| \le \sum_{k=p}^{q} |a_{k}|$.
* Since $\sum |a_k|$ converges, it satisfies the Cauchy Criterion (the tail $\sum_{k=p}^{q} |a_{k}|$ becomes arbitrarily small).
* Therefore, $|\sum_{k=p}^{q} a_{k}|$ also becomes arbitrarily small.
* By the Cauchy Criterion for series, $\sum a_{k}$ converges.

## 2. Testing for Absolute Convergence
To test $\sum a_k$ for absolute convergence, apply standard tests (Section 7.1) to $\sum |a_k|$.

### Theorem 7.3.4: Root and Ratio Tests
Let $\alpha = \limsup_{k\to\infty} \sqrt[k]{|a_k|}$ and $R = \limsup_{k\to\infty} |\frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k}|$, $r = \liminf_{k\to\infty} |\frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k}|$.

1.  **Convergence:** If $\alpha < 1$ or $R < 1$, the series is **absolutely convergent**.
2.  **Divergence:** If $\alpha > 1$ or $r > 1$, the series **diverges** (not just fails absolute convergence, but fails to converge entirely).
    * *Reasoning:* If limit > 1, the terms $|a_k|$ grow or do not approach 0. If $\lim a_k \neq 0$, the series diverges.
3.  **Inconclusive:** If $\alpha = 1$ or $r \le 1 \le R$, the test gives no information.

## 3. Rearrangements of Series

### Definition
A series $\sum a'_{k}$ is a **rearrangement** of $\sum a_{k}$ if there exists a one-to-one bijection $j: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that $a'_{k} = a_{j(k)}$.
* *Essence:* All terms of the original series appear exactly once, just in a different order.

### The Critical Question
Does rearranging the terms change the sum?
* **Absolutely Convergent Series:** No.
* **Conditionally Convergent Series:** **Yes.**

### Example of Failure (Conditional Convergence)
Consider $\sum \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k} = 1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} \dots$ (Sums to $s$).
* Rearrange to take two positive terms for every one negative term:
    $$1 + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{7} - \frac{1}{4} \dots$$
* The positive terms accumulate faster than the negative terms reduce the sum.
* The new sum $s'$ can be shown to be strictly greater than the original sum ($s' > s$).

## 4. Convergence Theorems regarding Rearrangement

### Theorem 7.3.8: Rearrangement of Absolute Series
**Statement:** If $\sum a_{k}$ converges absolutely, then *every* rearrangement converges to the same sum.

**Proof Idea (Internal Logic):**
1.  **Tail Control:** Since $\sum |a_k|$ converges, for any $\epsilon$, we can choose $N$ such that the sum of absolute values of the "tail" (terms after index $N$) is $< \epsilon$.
2.  **Matching Terms:** Let $s_n$ be the partial sum of the original and $s'_n$ be the partial sum of the rearrangement. Choose an index $p$ large enough so that the first $p$ terms of the rearrangement include all the first $N$ terms of the original series.
3.  **Cancellation:** In the difference $|s_n - s'_n|$ (for large $n$), the first $N$ terms cancel out perfectly.
4.  **Bound Remainder:** The remaining terms belong to the "tail" (indices $> N$). Since the sum of the absolute values of the tail is bounded by $\epsilon$, the difference $|s_n - s'_n|$ is negligible. The limits must be identical.

### Theorem 7.3.9: Riemann’s Rearrangement Theorem
**Statement:** If $\sum a_{k}$ is **conditionally convergent**, then for any real number $\alpha$, there exists a rearrangement $\sum a'_{k}$ that converges to $\alpha$.

**Proof Construction (The "Greedy" Algorithm):**
1.  **Decomposition:** Separate the series into positive terms ($P_k$) and negative terms ($Q_k$).
    * Because the series is *conditionally* convergent:
        * $\sum P_k = \infty$ (Positive part diverges)
        * $\sum Q_k = \infty$ (Negative part diverges)
        * $P_k \to 0$ and $Q_k \to 0$ (Terms vanish)
        * *Note:* If these didn't diverge, the series would be absolutely convergent or divergent.
2.  **Algorithm to target $\alpha$:**
    * **Step 1:** Add enough positive terms $P_k$ until the partial sum just exceeds $\alpha$. (Possible because $\sum P_k = \infty$).
    * **Step 2:** Subtract enough negative terms $Q_k$ until the partial sum just drops below $\alpha$. (Possible because $\sum Q_k = \infty$).
    * **Step 3:** Repeat indefinitely.
3.  **Convergence:**
    * At each step, we overshoot or undershoot $\alpha$ by at most the value of the single term we just added/subtracted.
    * Since $a_k \to 0$ (the individual terms approach zero), the size of these overshoots/undershoots approaches 0.
    * Therefore, the partial sums converge to $\alpha$.

**Remark:** This theorem implies conditionally convergent series are unstable regarding order; one can even rearrange them to diverge to $\pm \infty$.
