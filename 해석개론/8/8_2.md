### **1. Pointwise vs. Uniform Convergence**

To preserve properties like continuity or to interchange limit operations (integrals, derivatives), pointwise convergence is often insufficient. Stronger conditions are required.

#### **Pointwise Convergence (Recap)**
A sequence $\{f_n\}$ converges pointwise to $f$ on a set $E$ if for every $x \in E$ and $\epsilon > 0$, there exists an integer $n_0$ such that $|f_n(x) - f(x)| < \epsilon$ for all $n \ge n_0$.
* **Crucial Limitation:** The integer $n_0$ depends on both $\epsilon$ **and** $x$.
* Notation: $n_0 = n_0(x, \epsilon)$.

#### **Uniform Convergence (Definition 8.2.1)**
A sequence $\{f_n\}$ converges **uniformly** to $f$ on $E$ if for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists an integer $n_0$ such that:
$$|f_n(x) - f(x)| < \epsilon$$
for **all** $x \in E$ and all $n \ge n_0$.

* **Key Distinction:** The integer $n_0$ depends **only** on $\epsilon$, not on $x$. The dependence on $x$ is removed.
* **Geometric Interpretation:** For $n \ge n_0$, the entire graph of $f_n(x)$ lies within a "tube" of width $2\epsilon$ centered around $f(x)$.
    $$f(x) - \epsilon < f_n(x) < f(x) + \epsilon$$

### **2. Analysis of Specific Examples**

#### **Example A: $f_n(x) = x^n$ on $[0, 1]$**
* **Pointwise Limit:**
    $$f(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} x^n = \begin{cases} 0 & 0 \le x < 1 \\ 1 & x = 1 \end{cases}$$
    The limit function $f$ is discontinuous, even though each $f_n$ is continuous.
* **Uniform Convergence Test:**
    If convergence were uniform, there would exist $n_0$ such that $|x^{n_0} - 0| < \epsilon$ for all $x \in [0, 1)$.
    However, if we pick $\epsilon < 1$, the inequality $x^{n_0} < \epsilon$ fails as $x$ approaches 1.
    * **Conclusion:** Convergence is **not uniform** on $[0, 1]$.
    * **Note:** Convergence *is* uniform on $[0, a]$ for any fixed $0 < a < 1$, because $|x^n| \le a^n$, and $a^n \to 0$ independent of $x$.

#### **Example B: The "Sliding Hump" ($S_n(x) = nxe^{-nx^2}$)**
Consider the partial sums $S_n(x) = nxe^{-nx^2}$ on $[0, 1]$.
* **Pointwise Limit:** For any fixed $x$, $\lim_{n \to \infty} S_n(x) = 0$. The limit function is $S(x) = 0$.
* **Uniform Convergence Test:**
    We examine the maximum value of the function to see if it stays within $\epsilon$ distance of 0.
    Using the derivative, $S_n$ has a maximum at $x_n = \sqrt{1/2n}$.
    $$M_n = \max_{x \in [0,1]} S_n(x) = S_n\left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{2n}}\right) = \sqrt{\frac{n}{2e}}$$
        * **Conclusion:** Since $M_n \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$, the graph does not flatten out into an $\epsilon$-strip. The convergence is **not uniform**.
    * **Terminology:** These are called "sliding-hump" functions because the peak moves toward 0 (slides) but grows infinitely high (hump) as $n$ increases.

### **3. Criteria for Uniform Convergence**

#### **The Supremum Test (Theorem 8.2.5)**
This is the most practical method for determining uniform convergence.
Let $M_n = \sup_{x \in E} |f_n(x) - f(x)|$.
The sequence $\{f_n\}$ converges uniformly to $f$ on $E$ if and only if:
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} M_n = 0$$

* **Application to Example A ($x^n$):** On $[0, 1]$, $\sup |x^n - f(x)| = 1$ (near $x=1$). Since limit is 1, not 0, it is not uniform.
* **Application to Example B ($nxe^{-nx^2}$):** On $[0, \infty)$, $M_n = \sqrt{n/2e} \to \infty$. Not uniform. However, on $[a, \infty)$ for fixed $a > 0$, the maximum eventually occurs at the endpoint $a$, and decreases to 0. Thus, it is uniform on $[a, \infty)$.

#### **The Cauchy Criterion (Theorem 8.2.3)**
A sequence $\{f_n\}$ converges uniformly on $E$ if and only if for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists $n_0$ such that:
$$|f_n(x) - f_m(x)| < \epsilon$$
for all $x \in E$ and all $n, m \ge n_0$.

**Proof Idea:**
1.  **Forward ($\Rightarrow$):** Follows from the triangle inequality, similar to standard Cauchy sequences.
2.  **Reverse ($\Leftarrow$):**
    * Fix $x$. The sequence $\{f_n(x)\}$ is a Cauchy sequence of real numbers, so it converges to some value $y$. Define $f(x) = y$.
    * To prove uniformity, take the limit as $m \to \infty$ in the Cauchy inequality $|f_n(x) - f_m(x)| < \epsilon$. This yields $|f_n(x) - f(x)| \le \epsilon$, valid for all $x$, proving uniform convergence.

**Corollary for Series (8.2.4):**
A series $\sum f_k$ converges uniformly on $E$ if and only if for large enough $n, m$:
$$|\sum_{k=n+1}^{m} f_k(x)| < \epsilon \quad \forall x \in E$$

### **4. The Weierstrass M-Test**

A powerful tool for proving the uniform convergence of series.

#### **Theorem 8.2.7**
Suppose $\{f_k\}$ is defined on $E$ and there exists a sequence of constants $\{M_k\}$ such that:
1.  $|f_k(x)| \le M_k$ for all $x \in E$ and $k \in \mathbb{N}$.
2.  $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} M_k < \infty$ (The series of constants converges).

Then, $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} f_k(x)$ converges **uniformly** and **absolutely** on $E$.

**Proof Idea:**
Let $S_n(x)$ be the partial sums. For $n > m$:
$$|S_n(x) - S_m(x)| = \left| \sum_{k=m+1}^{n} f_k(x) \right| \le \sum_{k=m+1}^{n} |f_k(x)| \le \sum_{k=m+1}^{n} M_k$$
Since $\sum M_k$ converges, the tail of the series approaches 0. By the Cauchy Criterion, $\sum f_k$ converges uniformly.

#### **Examples of M-Test**
1.  **Trigonometric Series:** $\sum \frac{\cos kx}{k^p}$ for $p > 1$.
    * Bound: $|\frac{\cos kx}{k^p}| \le \frac{1}{k^p}$.
    * Since $\sum \frac{1}{k^p}$ converges (p-series), the trig series converges uniformly on $\mathbb{R}$.
2.  **Geometric Series:** $\sum (x/2)^k$ on $[-a, a]$ where $0 < a < 2$.
    * Bound: $|(x/2)^k| \le (a/2)^k$.
    * Since $a/2 < 1$, $\sum (a/2)^k$ converges. The series converges uniformly on $[-a, a]$.
    * *Note:* It does **not** converge uniformly on the open interval $(-2, 2)$ because the terms are not bounded by a single convergent geometric series near the endpoints.

### **5. Uniform vs. Absolute Convergence**

Uniform convergence and absolute convergence are distinct concepts. One does not necessarily imply the other.

#### **Case A: Uniform $\nRightarrow$ Absolute**
**Example:** $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{k+1} \frac{x^k}{k}$ on $[0, 1]$.
* **Uniform:** Let $a_k(x) = x^k/k$. The sequence $a_k(x)$ is decreasing and goes to 0 uniformly. By the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem, the error $|S(x) - S_n(x)| \le a_{n+1}(x) \le \frac{1}{n+1}$. Since the error bound $\frac{1}{n+1}$ is independent of $x$, convergence is uniform.
* **Not Absolute:** At $x=1$, the series of absolute values is $\sum \frac{1}{k}$ (Harmonic Series), which diverges.

#### **Case B: Absolute $\nRightarrow$ Uniform**
**Example:** $\sum x^2(1+x^2)^{-k}$ (from Example 8.1.2b).
* **Absolute:** The series consists of non-negative terms and converges pointwise to a discontinuous function ($0$ at $x=0$, $1+x^2$ elsewhere).
* **Not Uniform:** A series of continuous functions converging to a discontinuous function **cannot** be uniformly convergent (a key theorem to be discussed in later sections). Thus, absolute convergence does not guarantee uniformity.
