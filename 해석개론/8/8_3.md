### 2. Uniform Convergence and Continuity

This section addresses whether the limit of a sequence of continuous functions is continuous.

#### **Theorem 8.3.1: Interchange of Limits**
Let $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence of real-valued functions converging uniformly to $f$ on a subset $E$ of a metric space. Let $p$ be a limit point of $E$.
If $\lim_{x\rightarrow p}f_{n}(x)=A_{n}$ for each $n$, then:
1.  The sequence $\{A_n\}$ converges.
2.  $\lim_{x\rightarrow p}f(x) = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}A_{n}$.

**Formulaic Representation:**
$$\lim_{x\rightarrow p}(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f_{n}(x)) = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(\lim_{x\rightarrow p}f_{n}(x))$$

**Proof (Key Ideas):**
* **Step 1 ($A_n$ is Cauchy):** Since $f_n$ converges uniformly, $|f_n(x) - f_m(x)| < \epsilon$. Letting $x \to p$, we get $|A_n - A_m| \le \epsilon$. Thus $\{A_n\}$ converges to some limit $A$.
* **Step 2 (Convergence to A):** Use the $\epsilon/3$ argument via the Triangle Inequality:
    $$|f(x)-A| \le |f(x)-f_{m}(x)| + |f_{m}(x)-A_{m}| + |A_{m}-A|$$
    * Term 1 is small due to uniform convergence.
    * Term 2 is small because $\lim_{x \to p} f_m(x) = A_m$.
    * Term 3 is small because $A_m \to A$.

#### **Corollary 8.3.2: Preservation of Continuity**
* **(a) Sequences:** If $\{f_n\}$ are continuous on $E$ and converge uniformly to $f$, then $f$ is continuous on $E$.
* **(b) Series:** If $\{f_n\}$ are continuous and $\sum f_n$ converges uniformly to $S$, then $S$ is continuous.

**Proof Idea:**
If $p$ is a limit point, apply Theorem 8.3.1. Since $f_n$ is continuous, $\lim_{x\to p} f_n(x) = f_n(p)$. The theorem implies $\lim_{x\to p} f(x) = \lim f_n(p) = f(p)$.

#### **Counter-Examples (Why Uniformity Matters)**
* **Example 8.3.3:** The sequence $f_n(x) = x^n$ on $[0, 1]$ converges pointwise to a discontinuous function (0 on $[0,1)$, 1 at $x=1$). Thus, convergence is **not** uniform.
* The series $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}x^{2}(\frac{1}{1+x^{2}})^{k}$ converges to a function discontinuous at $x=0$, implying convergence is not uniform near 0.

### 3. Dini's Theorem

Does pointwise convergence ever imply uniform convergence? Generally no, but yes under specific conditions (monotonicity and compactness).

**Example 8.3.4 (Counter-example):**
$$S_n(x) = nxe^{-nx^2}, \quad x \in [0, 1]$$
* $S_n \to 0$ pointwise.
* Functions are continuous.
* **Failure:** The maximum value is $\sqrt{n/2e}$, which tends to $\infty$. The "hump" moves toward 0 but gets infinitely tall. Convergence is **not** uniform.

#### **Theorem 8.3.5: Dini's Theorem**
Let $K$ be a **compact** subset. Let $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence of continuous functions on $K$ such that:
1.  $\{f_n\}$ converges **pointwise** to a continuous function $f$.
2.  The sequence is **monotone**: $f_{n}(x) \ge f_{n+1}(x)$ for all $x, n$ (or increasing).

**Result:** $\{f_n\}$ converges **uniformly** to $f$ on $K$.

**Proof (Key Ideas):**
1.  Define $g_n = f_n - f$. Then $g_n$ is continuous, $g_n \ge 0$, $g_n \ge g_{n+1}$, and $g_n \to 0$ pointwise.
2.  Let $\epsilon > 0$. Define sets $K_n = \{x \in K : g_n(x) \ge \epsilon\}$.
3.  Since $g_n$ is continuous, $K_n$ is closed. Since $K$ is compact, $K_n$ is **compact**.
4.  By monotonicity ($g_n \ge g_{n+1}$), the sets are nested: $K_{n+1} \subset K_n$.
5.  Since $g_n(x) \to 0$ for every $x$, the intersection $\bigcap K_n = \emptyset$.
6.  **Finite Intersection Property:** For compact sets, if the infinite intersection is empty, a finite intersection must be empty. Thus, $K_{N} = \emptyset$ for some $N$.
7.  This implies $0 \le g_n(x) < \epsilon$ for all $n \ge N$ and all $x \in K$, proving uniform convergence.

**Example 8.3.6 (Necessity of Compactness):**
$f_n(x) = \frac{1}{nx+1}$ on $(0, 1)$. Monotonically decreases to 0. Convergence is **not** uniform (near $x=0$, $f_n \to 1$) because the domain $(0,1)$ is not compact.

### 4. The Space $\mathcal{C}(K)$

This section formalizes the set of continuous functions as a normed linear space. Let $K$ be a compact set. $\mathcal{C}(K)$ is the vector space of all continuous real-valued functions on $K$.

#### **Uniform Norm**
**Definition 8.3.7:** For $f \in \mathcal{C}(K)$, the uniform norm is:
$$||f||_{u} = \max\{|f(x)| : x \in K\}$$
*(Note: Maximum exists because K is compact and f is continuous).*

**Theorem 8.3.8 (Equivalence):**
A sequence $f_n$ converges uniformly to $f$ in $\mathcal{C}(K)$ **if and only if** it converges in the uniform norm:
$$\lim_{n\to\infty} ||f_n - f||_u = 0$$

#### **Completeness**
**Definition 8.3.10:**
* A sequence $\{x_n\}$ in a normed space is **Cauchy** if $||x_n - x_m|| < \epsilon$ for large $n, m$.
* A space is **Complete** if every Cauchy sequence converges to an element within the space.

**Theorem 8.3.11:** The space $(\mathcal{C}(K), ||\cdot||_u)$ is **complete**.
**Proof (Key Ideas):**
1.  Take a Cauchy sequence $\{f_n\}$ in $\mathcal{C}(K)$.
2.  $|f_n(x) - f_m(x)| \le ||f_n - f_m||_u < \epsilon$. This means $\{f_n(x)\}$ is a uniformly Cauchy sequence of real numbers.
3.  By previous theorems (Cauchy criterion for uniform convergence), $\{f_n\}$ converges uniformly to some function $f$.
4.  Since $f_n$ are continuous and convergence is uniform, limit $f$ is continuous (Corollary 8.3.2). Thus $f \in \mathcal{C}(K)$.
5.  Therefore, the sequence converges to $f$ in the norm.

### 5. Contraction Mappings

Extension of contraction functions to normed linear spaces.

**Definition 8.3.12:**
Let $(X, ||\cdot||)$ be a normed linear space. A mapping $T: X \to X$ is a **contraction** if there exists a constant $c$ ($0 < c < 1$) such that for all $x, y \in X$:
$$||T(x) - T(y)|| \le c||x - y||$$

#### **Theorem 8.3.13: Banach Fixed Point Theorem**
Let $X$ be a **complete** normed linear space. If $T$ is a contraction mapping, there exists a **unique** fixed point $x \in X$ such that $T(x) = x$.

**Proof (Key Ideas):**
1.  **Existence (Iterative Sequence):**
    * Pick arbitrary $x_0$. Define $x_n = T(x_{n-1})$.
    * Show $\{x_n\}$ is Cauchy: $||x_{n+1} - x_n|| \le c^n ||x_1 - x_0||$.
    * Using geometric series sum, $||x_{n+m} - x_n|| \le \frac{c^n}{1-c}||x_1 - x_0||$.
    * Since $0 < c < 1$, $c^n \to 0$, so sequence is Cauchy.
    * Since $X$ is complete, $x_n \to x$ for some $x \in X$.
    * By continuity of $T$: $x = \lim x_{n+1} = \lim T(x_n) = T(x)$.
2.  **Uniqueness:**
    * Assume $T(x)=x$ and $T(y)=y$.
    * $||x-y|| = ||T(x)-T(y)|| \le c||x-y||$.
    * Since $c < 1$, this implies $||x-y|| = 0$, so $x=y$.
