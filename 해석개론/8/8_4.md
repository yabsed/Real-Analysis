Here is a concise, self-contained summary of **Section 8.4: Uniform Convergence and Integration** from the provided text.

### 1. Motivation: The Failure of Pointwise Convergence
Pointwise convergence is **not sufficient** to preserve Riemann integrability or to interchange the limit and the integral.

* **Problem 1 (Integrability):** A sequence of Riemann integrable functions $\{f_n\}$ can converge pointwise to a limit function $f$ that is **not** Riemann integrable.
* **Problem 2 (Value of Integral):** Even if the limit function $f$ is integrable, the integral of the limit may not equal the limit of the integrals.
    * *Example:* There exists a sequence of continuous functions on $[0, 1]$ where $\lim_{n\to\infty} f_n(x) = 0$ for all $x$, yet:
        $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \int_{0}^{1} f_n(x) \, dx \neq \int_{0}^{1} \left( \lim_{n\to\infty} f_n(x) \right) dx$$
    * Specifically, in a previous example (8.1.2d), the integrals evaluated to $\frac{1}{2}\frac{n}{n+1} \to \frac{1}{2}$, while the integral of the zero limit function is $0$.

### 2. Main Theorem: Uniform Convergence
Uniform convergence provides the sufficient condition to guarantee both the integrability of the limit and the interchange of operations.

#### **Theorem 8.4.1**
Suppose $f_n \in \mathcal{R}[a, b]$ (Riemann integrable) for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and $\{f_n\}$ converges **uniformly** to $f$ on $[a, b]$. Then:
1.  $f \in \mathcal{R}[a, b]$ (The limit is integrable).
2.  The limit can be moved inside the integral:
    $$\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx = \lim_{n\to\infty} \int_{a}^{b} f_n(x) \, dx$$

#### **Proof Strategy (Key Ideas)**
The proof relies on "squeezing" the function $f$ between the sequence functions using the uniform error bound.

1.  **Define the error:** Let $\epsilon_n = \sup_{x\in[a,b]} |f_n(x) - f(x)|$. Because convergence is uniform, $\lim_{n\to\infty} \epsilon_n = 0$.
2.  **Establish bounds:** From the definition of absolute value, for all $x \in [a, b]$:
    $$f_n(x) - \epsilon_n \leq f(x) \leq f_n(x) + \epsilon_n$$
3.  **Integrability Argument:**
    Using the properties of Upper ($\overline{\int}$) and Lower ($\underline{\int}$) integrals:
    $$\int_a^b (f_n - \epsilon_n) \leq \underline{\int_a^b} f \leq \overline{\int_a^b} f \leq \int_a^b (f_n + \epsilon_n)$$
    The difference between the upper and lower integrals of $f$ is bounded by the difference of the outer terms:
    $$0 \leq \overline{\int_a^b} f - \underline{\int_a^b} f \leq 2\epsilon_n(b - a)$$
    Since $\epsilon_n \to 0$, the upper and lower integrals must be equal. Thus, $f \in \mathcal{R}[a, b]$.
4.  **Convergence of Values:**
    Using the same inequality bounds:
    $$\left| \int_a^b f(x)dx - \int_a^b f_n(x)dx \right| \leq \int_a^b |f(x) - f_n(x)| dx \leq \epsilon_n(b-a)$$
    As $n \to \infty$, the right side vanishes, proving the equality of the integrals.

### 3. Application to Series
This theorem extends naturally to infinite series of functions.

#### **Corollary 8.4.2**
If $f_k \in \mathcal{R}[a, b]$ and the series $f(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} f_k(x)$ converges **uniformly** on $[a, b]$, then $f$ is integrable and we can integrate term-by-term:
$$\int_{a}^{b} \left( \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} f_k(x) \right) dx = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \int_{a}^{b} f_k(x) \, dx$$

**Proof Idea:** Apply Theorem 8.4.1 to the sequence of partial sums, $S_n(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} f_k(x)$.

---

### 4. Nuance: Sufficient but Not Necessary
Uniform convergence guarantees the interchange of limits and integrals, but it is not strictly required. The interchange can sometimes work even if convergence is only pointwise.

#### **Counter-Example: $f_n(x) = x^n$ on $[0, 1]$**
* **Convergence:** This sequence converges pointwise to:
    $$f(x) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } 0 \leq x < 1 \\ 1 & \text{if } x = 1 \end{cases}$$
    The convergence is **not uniform** (the function becomes arbitrarily steep near $x=1$).
* **Integrability:** Despite the discontinuity at $x=1$, the limit $f$ is Riemann integrable and $\int_0^1 f(x)dx = 0$.
* **Limit of Integrals:**
    $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \int_{0}^{1} x^n \, dx = \lim_{n\to\infty} \left[ \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} \right]_0^1 = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n+1} = 0$$
* **Conclusion:** $\lim \int = \int \lim$ holds here, even without uniform convergence.

### 5. The Bounded Convergence Theorem (BCT)
To address cases where convergence is not uniform (like $x^n$), a stronger theorem from Lebesgue theory is introduced (Theorem 8.4.3).

**Hypotheses:**
1.  $f_n$ and $f$ are Riemann integrable on $[a, b]$.
2.  $f_n \to f$ pointwise.
3.  **Boundedness:** There exists a constant $M > 0$ such that $|f_n(x)| \leq M$ for all $x \in [a, b]$ and all $n$.

**Conclusion:**
$$\lim_{n\to\infty} \int_{a}^{b} f_n(x) \, dx = \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx$$

**Analysis of Examples using BCT:**
* **$f_n(x) = x^n$:** Satisfies BCT ($|x^n| \leq 1$ on $[0,1]$). This explains why the integral limit works despite lack of uniformity.
* **"Moving Hump" Example (8.1.2d):** This sequence (which had $\int f_n \to 1/2$ but $\int f = 0$) fails the hypotheses of BCT. While not detailed in this section, such functions usually fail the uniform boundedness condition ($M$) or the specific integrability requirements of the limit in more complex scenarios.
